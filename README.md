Click 'n Extend
--------
As the name implies, *Click 'n Extend* helps devout toad fans to take out one second out of their lives and give it to the Elder toad by a simple click/tap on the webpage.

[Demo](https://moscript.github.io/click-n-extend)

*Note: Enter "续命.知多少" in the console to see how many seconds you have prolonged on the current page, and "续命.闷声" to hide them.*

***Usage:***

To use it on your mogical website, just add this line of code in the `<body>`.

    <script src="https://moscript.github.io/click-n-extend/click-n-extend.js"></script>
Optionally, you can download the script and host it yourself.
